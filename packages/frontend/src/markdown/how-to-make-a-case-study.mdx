# How to make a Case Study

# II : Design Principles

&#x20;

> “*A successful UX in a blockchain application makes it seamless for someone to start using the application regardless of the technology behind it.” - Vanessa Colina, InVision, 2017.*

1.  **Value Proposition??**

    “***Value Propositions** (outside of currency speculation) are not clearly articulated to users through apps. Many apps may anticipate becoming gateways for people to interact in a Web3 enabled ecosystem, but so far, that ecosystem does not exist, so the apps have no obvious use.”*
2.  **Educate the user through active guidance**

    1.  Keep language accessible & reduce technical jargon, explain complicated (scary) on-chain interactions, implement help patterns + utilize glossaries.
    2.  Anticipate a user’s knowledge path while using a platform. Progressively increase their exposure to blockchain patterns, or segment experiences into different levels of understanding.
    3.  Guest Mode
3.  **Design for trust (or) Design with openness and transparency**

    1.  Be straightforward about risk.
    2.  Show the details of and history behind transactions
    3.  Manage expectations for transactions, such as :

        1.  Provide in-app statuses for active and wait periods
        2.  Show fees in local currency
        3.  Explain gas fees
        4.  Explain immutability of the user’s decisions
