# Mutual Design Principles

This is a living document that reflects our collective mindset towards designing blockchain enabled applications. If you're interested in contributing to this document, please visit our [contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) in the adjacent markdown file.

## Actively educative

We're operating in an emerging environment where the majority of users will be new to applications and their capacities. It is necessary to be critical about the assumptions that are being made surrounding terminology and product interactions.

1. Be eager to explain
2. Establish thoughtful patterns
3. Reduce technical jargon
4. Utilize glossaries

## Design for trust (or) design with openness and transparency

1. Be straightforward about risk.
2. Show the details of and history behind transactions
3. Manage expectations for transactions

- Provide in-app statuses for active and wait periods
- Show fees in local currency
- Explain gas fees
- Explain immutability of the userâ€™s decisions

## Visual consistency

1. We have the opportunity to establish fundamental design interactions for a new era of the internet. Similar to the impact of swiping, pinch to zoom, etc.
2. Testing patterns and then utilizing proven ones consistently throughout web3 platforms will help achieve mass understanding and lower the learning curve for new users.

## Anticipate mistakes

1. Design constant feedback into the experience for new users. Reduce their anxiety and potential for making mistakes.
2. Add in points of friction (i.e confirmation modals) to reduce errors and help direct user to their next step.
