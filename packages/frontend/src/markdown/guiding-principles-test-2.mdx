# Guiding Principles Test 2

\*Written by Neesh Chaudhary for MUTUAL. \*As a collective, MUTUAL has surveyed and built many consumer facing crypto applications. We  have been asked by our friends at Decent and Privy to distill our thoughts on building stellar user experiences on Ethereum into a group of Guiding Principles, which are presented below.

&#x20;

The guidance we offer is tied to the current state of consumer apps on Ethereum, and is not future-proof. We intend for this list to refine and evolve over time, as new observations are discovered and the blockchain industry integrates further into society.

A few of our personal views for consideration;

* The user experiences our industry creates now and for the foreseeable future will form the path to adoption for blockchain-enabled products.
* We have the opportunity to establish behavior primitives for users adopting a new era of consumer products.
* Testing new patterns and utilizing proven ones consistently throughout blockchain-enabled platforms will help achieve mass understanding and lower the learning curve for users.       &#x20;

# **Guiding Principles**

**Users deserve better value propositions for utilizing blockchain consumer products **

* How does what we build fit into the lives of users? Without a trustworthy ecosystem that can be fully integrated into their current online lives, they will be hesitant to fully adopt unfamiliar products and services.

  * Builders should consider engaging users further by highlighting the touchpoints in our products where the back-end (blockchain technology) is making their lives better / filling a gap
  * We can do more to treat our potential users with respect, both as future shareholders and those who will drive a company’s ability to survive. 

    * *“Value Propositions (outside of currency speculation) are not clearly articulated to users through apps. Many apps may anticipate becoming gateways for people to interact in a Web3 enabled ecosystem, but so far, that ecosystem does not exist, so the apps have no obvious use.”* - [CRADL](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s2OPSH5sMJzxRYaJSSRTe8W2iIoZx0PseIV-WeZWD1s/edit#slide=id.p)

**Mobile-first approach should be a standard if we want our industry to be competitive.**

* Our systems should resemble the experiences that users are accustomed to in their daily lives, such as a smooth and integrated mobile experience. Pure and simple.

**Users deserve to be more than a transaction statistic.**

* Startups should consider adding touches of humanization to our KPIs, taking focus away from user statistics that determine platform success being purely financially tied.

  * This is a way to become more relatable to mass adopters stepping into a new world.
* Many startups are not holding themselves accountable to user retention rates when it comes to platform usability. “Number of transactions” should not be the only barometer for the success of a product built using blockchain technology. 

  * *How much time did a user actually spend enjoying other aspects of your product other than completing a transaction on it? Do you provide alternative paths for engagement for users?*

**Realistic Interoperability**

* Admit to what you can’t directly control, but also promise to be better at collaborating with / putting positive pressure on those building infrastructure
* There are only certain factors us building these platforms can control. We are at the hands of third party service providers, e.g Metamask.
* Companies should be more realistic about the current state of available infrastructure and not continually live in the future promises of protocols and infrastructure companies when it comes to their own product roadmaps. Under-promise and overdeliver to help users understand where they fit in our product’s future.

**Active Guidance vs. Abstraction of Technology**

* Many experiences (not all) are designed for either an early adopter audience or mass adopter audience. Creating pathways for a range of experiences is how we can respect our users’ level of knowledge on using a crypto wallet or interacting with the blockchain.
* As builders we can either hide or abstract away a technical problem that is making the life of the user difficult. Or, we can explain it better by : 

  * Keep language accessible & reduce technical jargon, explain complicated (scary) on-chain interactions, implement help patterns + utilize glossaries.
  * Anticipate a user’s knowledge path while using a platform. Progressively increase their exposure to blockchain patterns, or segment experiences into different levels of understanding.
  * Examples : 

    * ‘Wallet-less’ experiences that allow users to port their existing identities
    * “Guest Mode” for newbies
    * Transactions with both Fiat and Crypto (verse.works does it beautifully)
    * “Completely hiding the crypto aspect from the UX. Social login, no private keys, no chance of losing your account, no gas, no visible transaction fees.” 

**Preservation**

* Let’s preserve the things that make building on-chain special, without compromising

  * Ideas that we care about preserving, without which would defeat the purpose of building “onchain” : 

    * User ownership

      * users are the only parties that can take action on the assets in their wallets
    * Cross-app interoperability

      * users can always take their assets with them from app to app
